Regex as a basic of NLP things

When I wanna learn about NLP for making chatbot, I found curriculum that show **regex** as an important things. I learn at Codebasics's Youtube Channel (https://youtu.be/lK9gx4q_vfI?si=_8OT-0qqwaR0XJZE). Also, I found cheatsheet at Datacamp's website (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcheat-sheet%2Fregular-expresso&psig=AOvVaw2ir9eFgUxplmL7DdmsMrVv&ust=1729487408666000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCNiDnOeYnIkDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) and you can find on my repo.
